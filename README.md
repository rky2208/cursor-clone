## Why This Project?

I wanted to practice building real-world layouts without relying on frameworks. This project helped me get better at:

- Writing semantic HTML
- Understanding Flexbox and Grid deeply
- Organizing CSS so it doesn't become a mess
- Building pixel-perfect designs from scratch

## What's Inside

**Tech:**

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid)
- Custom fonts (Inter + Geist Mono)

**File Structure:**

```

- index.html
- index.css
- src/assets/
  - png/ # all png format images
  - svg/ # all vector images
```

---

## How to Run

No setup needed. Just open `index.html` in your browser.

**For a better experience:**

- Use **Live Server** in VS Code
